# Desafio 100 Open Startups

## About the Project

The challenge was to build a system for startups registration. I created a home, login, signup, create company and edit company screens. The site is responsive from 414px up. This is the back end of the application. To access the front end, go to the following repository: https://github.com/fabriciopolato/100-open-frontend.

### Built With:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.
